### Problem:
Given an adjacency-list representation of a directed graph, how long does it take to compute the out-degree of every vertex? How long does it take to compute the in-degrees?

### Answer:
To compute the out-degree of every vertex, we'll need to iterate through all vertices and for each vertex we will need to iterate through all edges. This makes it: O(|E|+|V|).

```
out_degree = {}
for i in E:
	for j in V:
		out_degree[i]++
```

To compute the in-degree of every vertex, we'll need to itearate through all vertices and edges. Every time we meet a vertix that is being "pointed to", we keep track of the count. This makes it: O(|E|+|V|).


```
in_degree = {}
for i in E:
	for j in V:
		in_degree[j]++
```
