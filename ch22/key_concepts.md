## Graph Representations:
 + There are two ways to present a graph: in an adjacency list or adjacency matrix.
 + Density of a graph is measured by the relative ratio of number of edges with respect
 to vertices (|E|^2/|V|^2).

Adjacency List | Adjacency Matrix
--- | ---
take V + E memory space | takes V^2 memory space
--- | ---
suitable for sparse graphs | suitable for dense graphs
--- | ---
checking if two edges are directly connected is more expensive | checking if two edges are directly connected is cheap
